Implementations of Data Structures, Algorithms and cool programming problems in pure JavaScript.

**Motivation**

I started strengthening my Data Structures and Algorithm skills recently. Being a Frontend Engineer I naturally chose JavaScript to implement whatever I learnt. There are lot of implementations of generic Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, C and C++. But I couldn't find any in JavaScript while searching for references. 

So, I made this repo as a workspace for putting up my solutions and implementations out there for everybody to see. 

I will be putting up solutions to some interesting problems and basic data structures and algorithms gradually. 

Please raise a PR for bug fixes or missing test cases.
